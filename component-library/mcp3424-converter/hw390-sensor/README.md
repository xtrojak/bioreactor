# HW-390 Soil Moisture Sensor

This Capacitive Soil Moisture Sensor can be potentially used to detect the medium volume in the bioreactor by measuring the medium level. See [hw390.pdf](hw390.pdf) for a usage tutorial, and [board_chematic.pdf](board_schematic.pdf) for a more detailed description of sensor components.
