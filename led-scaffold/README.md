# LED Scaffold

This folder contains 3D files for the LED scaffold that holds together the lighting of the bioreactor. The mechanism covers half the reactor and can house 15 LEDs in three rows and five columns. The scaffold is held together using screws, and the space between the LEDs is filled with cardboard/plastic, possibly with reflexive foil on the inside.

Important mechanical properties:
 - The PCB thickness is assumed to be `1mm Â±0.1mm` and dimensions are `20x12mm`.
 - For the cardboard infill, one needs ten `20x12mm` pieces, and five `20x14mm` pieces (top).
 - The screws and bolts are M1.6 (DIN 912 and DIN 934 are recommended). 
 - The screws are `5mm` long, not including approx. `1.6mm` clearance for the screw head.

Since the parts are quite small, high quality printer settings are recommended (`0.1mm` layer height or better). Overall, a complete scaffold covering half the reactor consists of two `scaffold-ring.stl` prints, two `scaffold-beam-edge.stl` prints, and four `scaffold-beam-middle.stl` prints. Together, this is approx. `3.5h` of print time, not including overhead.
